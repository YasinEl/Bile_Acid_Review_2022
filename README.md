# Figures from the Dorrestein Bile Acid Review for Nature Gastroenterology and Hepatology

## Figure 1b 
Shows overlap of bile acids (via SMILES) across the databases Human Metabolite Database (HMDB), BILELIB19, and LIPIDMAPS. All structurs with a the SMARTS defined substructure “C-,=C12-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=1-,=C-,=C-,=C3-,=C4-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=4(-,=C-,=C-,=C-,=3-,=2)-,=C” and a 'C(=O)O', 'C(=O)N', or 'C(=O)S' in the carboxylic tail. Diastereomeric information was removed before SMILES were matched.

## Figure 1c
Shows mass differences as calculated by subtracting the mass of the unconjugated bile acid (C24H40+xO2+x with x = ‘number of hydroxyl modifications’ on the respective bile acid) from the mass of the (potentially) conjugated bile acid. Only mass differenzes > 40 Da are shown. 

## Box 1
Shows mean concentrations of different bile acids in blood and bile reported in the HMDB.
